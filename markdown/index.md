# Course Overview 

This is one of two offerings of Discrete Mathematics this semester,
a course designed to provide the mathematical tools needed for later CS courses.
This version is shared by Elizabeth Orrico and Luther Tychonievich (sections 002, 003, and 004).

If you are in Kevin Sullivan's section (001), please see <http://provablesystems.com/> instead.

## Eligibility

You should take this course if and only if

1. You have credit (or passed the placement test) for at least one of CS 1110, CS 1111, CS 1112, CS 1113, or CS 1120

## Learning Outcomes

At the conclusion of this course, a successful student will be able to

- Communicate using first-order logic to unambiguously specify claims, including
    - converting between English and logic
    - proper use of alternating quantifiers
- Prove theorems and write prose proofs by hand, utilizing the following proof techniques
    - direct proof
    - proof by contradiction
    - proof by cases
    - induction
- Converse in the language of sets, including proper use of
    - set operators (notation and meaning)
    - set-builder notation
    - cardinality, both finite and infinite (but not classes of infinity)
- Categorize functions as invertable, 1-to-1, and onto
- Identify relations with the reflexive, transitive, and associative properties, and identify equivalence relations in particular
- Understand and use 
    - summation notation
    - counting rules
    - prime factorization
    - logarithms

# Writeups

From time to time I create reference pages intended to supplement the textbooks ([MCS](files/mcs.pdf) and [âˆ€x](files/forallx.pdf), the latter also having a [solution book](http://forallx.openlogicproject.org/solutions/forallxsol.pdf));
I have no obvious place to list those supplements so I'm listing them here. They are:

- [On Proofs](proofs.html), including four different uses of the word "proof"
- [Symbols we'll use](symbols.html), which is made available during in-class quizzes
- [Operator precedence](mainoperator.html) and how it helps convert between English and logic
- [Six meanings of "everyone can fit in a bus"](bus-example.html), an introduction to quantifiers and the purpose of jargon
- [Axioms](axioms.html), being useful tools out of which we build proofs
- [Guide to Direct Proof](direct.html)
- [English to Quantifiers](eng2quant.html)
- [Sets primer](sets.html)
- [induction addenda](induction.html)
- [Proof Techniques](techniques-q8.html), a list of techniques with tips on proof writing
- [Logical Reduction](reducibility.html)
- [MCS 4 addenda](chap4.html)
- [Glossary of logical terms](glossary.html)
- Example proofs, including [De Morgan's laws](demorgan.html), [bubble sort](bubble.html), [Cantor diagonalization](cantor.html), [open sets](openset.html), [irrationality of various numbers](irrationality.html)
- All in-class labs and quizzes from
    - [Fall 2019](files/f2019)
    - [Spring 2020](files/s2020)
    - [Fall 2020](files/f2020) -- added after they are graded
