## Meetings

Due to COVID-19 space restrictions, we do not have assigned classrooms for this course, so all class meetings will happen online.

[Details of those meetings will be posted her later.]{style="color:red"}

## Tasks {#tasks}

You will be expected to read instructional material and either understand it or ask questions to clarify what you found confusing. We strongly recommend forming study groups that meet at least weekly all semester long to discuss readings, as even if they appear simple at first they will often contain nuances that will only emerge with conversions.

You will be asked to perform two:

- Manually-graded paper quizzes
    - You will
        - be given a prompt and a time limit
        - write a solution on paper
        - take a picture of your paper and upload it
    - We will
        - grade based on a rubric
        - upload your grade and comments
        - discuss common mistakes in class

- Automatically-graded online quizzes
    - You will
        - be given a set of questions with a web form for answering them
        - write clarifying comments if the question is confusingly worded
    - The system will
        - provide a first-pass grade and distribution of grades
    - We will
        - discuss common mistakes in class
        - review comments and adjust grades if appropriate
    
At the end of the semester, you will also be able to take a final quiz, which is graded and is intended to help you show increased mastery of topics where you previously failed to show mastery.

## Contact

All
:   We recommend using [Piazza or Discord; we haven't decided which one yet]{style="color:red"} for any communication with course staff about course content.

    Contact
    :   Do not contact TAs individually unless specifically invited to do so by course staff.
        
        Our TAs are students too, with duties and work outside of their TAing. Please do not ask them to act as your TA except at the scheduled on-the-clock times they have listed as their office hours. They are also kind people; please don't put them in the position of having to say no or (worse) being nice to you at the expense of their own schooling.

## Readings

It is possible to do well in this class based only on in-class instruction.
However, most students find they learn more rapidly and easily if they augment that with appropriate readings.

Our readings come from three sources:

- The free online textbook *Mathematics for Computer Science* by Eric Lehman, Thomson Leighton, and Albert Meyer,
available both [on our site](files/mcs.pdf)
and [on MIT's site](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/readings/MIT6_042JS15_textbook.pdf).
Readings that begin "MCS" refer to sections of that book;
for example, "MCS 1.7" refers to the section "Proof by Cases".

- The free online textbook *forall x Calgary Remix* by P D Mangus *et al*,
available both [on our site](files/forallx.pdf)
and [from the Open Logic Project](http://forallx.openlogicproject.org/).
Readings that begin "∀x" refer to sections of that book;
for example, "∀x 15.1" refers to the section "The idea of a formal proof".

- Write-ups by our course staff, hosted on this site and provided by a link.

I will use ".0" to mean "the text before .1";
for example, "∀x 1.0" is the content of chapter 1 preceding section 1.1.

## Proofs

You will both write and read proofs as part of this class.
If you have had a proof-heavy math class before, you know what to expect here.
If not, think of proof writing as being more similar to code writing than to other forms of mathematics homework in terms of time needed and difficulty of estimating exact time needed for any given problem.


# Grading

In February 2019 the CS faculty approved [a definition](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/grading-guidelines.html) of what we believe grades mean.
We try to approximate that definition in this course.
As a brief summary,

Letter  Student demonstrated                Recommendation re future courses[^future]
------  ---------------------------         ------------------------------------
A       mastery of all topics               likely to do well
B       competence in significant topics    able to do well with some review
C       sufficient competence               likely to be challenging
D       minimal competence                  unlikely to succeed
F       less than minimal competence        retake this course first

[^future]:
    Most of our courses depend on CS 2102 topics in some way.
    Theory (CS 3102) and Algo (CS 4102) have particularly strong dependencies, as do many of our electives.

To achieve this goal, our grading system is a bit more complicated than a simple point total, as we want to ensure that you have adequate exposure to each topic that later courses depend on.

Each individual autograded-quiz question and hand-graded rubric item will be assigned to one or more of the following topics:

Logical expression
:   understanding what logical expressions mean and converting between English and logic

Logical operation
:   using axioms and rules to manipulate and evaluate logic, including direct proof and proof by cases

Proof strategies
:   induction, contradiction, and the form of prose proofs

Mathematical terminology
:   sets, functions, relations, sequences, factorization, logarithms, and counting
    
To do well in subsequent courses, you need to attain adequate understanding of all four of these concepts.
Getting 100% in three and 0% in one is far worse than getting 75% in all four.
To reflect this, your grade will be computed as

:::{style="color:red"}
not yet certain; possibly the fours scores for a set $S$ and your score is
$\max\big(\min(S)+15, \max(s)\big)$
:::

Missed auto-graded evaluations will not be rescheduled, extended, nor made up during the semester.
Missed hand-graded evaluations [may be rescheduled with adequate notice and reasoning.]{style="color:red"}

The final quiz will be an opportunity to show mastery in topics that you failed to show mastery of during the semester, whether because you failed to take the relevant assessments or because you did not perform well on them.
It will be organized as a separate evaluation for each course evaluation area as noted above. You pick and choose which to take; those you do take will replace your score in that area. If you do not need such an opportunity (i.e., you have already shown mastery before the final) you will not need to take the final quiz.

UVA does not award credit for placement tests. If you have not shown continuing evidence of engagement and learning throughout the course, the final quiz may not be enough to change that.

# Miscellanea

## Professionalism

Behave professionally.

Never abuse anyone, including the emotional abuse of blaming others for your mistakes.
Kindness is more important than correctness.

Let our TAs be students when they are not on the clock as TAs.

## Honesty

We always hope everyone will behave honestly.
We know we all are tempted to do what we ought not;
if you do something you regret, the sooner you tell us the sooner (and more leniently) we can correct it.

### No plagiarism (nor anything like it)

The quizzes allow consulting many resources.
However, if you consult resources other than course material, you **must** cite any and every source you consult in the comments of the question.
Talked to a friend, saw an interesting video, consulted a website, had a tutor?
Tell us!

### Obey collaboration limitations

Quizzes may not be done in groups or in consultation with any resource that did not exist prior to the quiz being posted.

### Consequences of Dishonesty

If we believe you have acted dishonestly, we will communicate this fact to you and propose a penalty.
If you have information we lack, please share that with us; we may thereafter change our belief and/or proposed penalty.

If we are not able to come to an agreement, or if the case is particularly egregious and beyond our comfort level handling in-course, we will instead refer the case to the University Honor System and abide by their findings.


## Personal accommodations

### Disability

If you qualify for accommodations from [the SDAC](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac), please let your professor know, preferably [in their office]{style="color:red"} so we can discuss how your accommodations will interplay with the content delivery and assessment structure of this course.

### Religious observances

We fully support [the university's stance](https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance) on accommodating religious observances.
If such observances or other religious beliefs impact or are likely to impact your work this semester,
please let us know as soon as you are aware of this impact.

### Culture

All communication relies on shared context and understanding.
Because no member of our course staff has the same context and experience as you, it is likely we will inadvertently say and do things you find confusing or offensive. Please let us know if this happens! We will do our best to learn and adjust so we can become better and more welcoming communicators in the future, and to do what we can to fix any problems our mistakes caused.

### Life

Bad things happen.
People forget things and make mistakes.
Bad days coincide with due dates.
Etc.

If you believe that circumstances warrant an change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, talk to your professor and we'll resolve the situation as best we can.
